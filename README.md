# Compress-JPEG-image-using-Python-
Select your favorite photo from Joensuu (taken either by yourself or a friend). Then find a tool to compress the image by JPEG. Apply it with 10 different quality ratios and report the results as:

·    File sizes measured as bit rates (bits per pixel).

·    Visual error on a scale of 0-10  (0=perfect, 5=visible errors, 10=useless)

Plot the results similarly as in the rate/distortion-curve below.
